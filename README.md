**Citi Bike Trip History Logs Project**
Overview: The analysis leverages Citi Bike Trip History Logs to explore patterns in bike usage across New York City. The goal is to identify two unexpected phenomena that can inform city officials and administrators about trends and operational needs.

**Phenomenon 1: Seasonal Shifts in Ridership**
Unexpectedly, we discovered significant shifts in ridership patterns between the month of January to March, which have important implications for resource allocation.

Visualizations:
Hourly Distribution of Trips in Summer vs Winter:
Heatmaps were created to show peak usage hours for bikes in both summer and winter months. This helped reveal how the temperature and weather patterns affect bike usage.
Monthly Trends by Season:
Line graphs illustrate the total trips taken by month, showing the large drop in ridership during the winter months.
Growth in Monthly Subscribers During Winter:
A bar chart compared the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers. Interestingly, there was a sharp increase in annual subscribers during the colder months, possibly due to people trying to commit to biking more for their fitness routines or daily commutes.
Analysis Conclusion: This seasonal shift highlights a critical insight for city officials: while winter months see a dip in ridership, annual subscribers continue to use the system. This suggests a potential need for increasing bike availability or adjusting maintenance schedules during the colder months, especially at popular indoor locations like gyms or office buildings.

**Phenomenon 2: Overlooked Usage in Off-Peak Locations**
Through analyzing stations with the highest and lowest usage rates, we discovered that certain neighborhoods, which are typically overlooked in public transport planning, have high peak usage during non-typical hours.

Visualizations:
Top and Bottom 10 Stations for Starting and Ending Journeys:

A bar chart showed the most popular starting and ending stations for trips. Interestingly, some stations in less dense neighborhoods exhibited high usage during evenings and weekends.
Map of Station Popularity:

A map visualization highlighted station locations, with color-coding based on popularity. It uncovered areas that are not typically seen as “hotspots” in other transport data but have a growing number of users.
Trip Duration and Distance by Station:

Scatter plots were used to show the relationship between trip durations and distances for the top stations. The surprising finding was that stations in quieter areas had shorter trips, but these users were consistent, indicating a need for more localized bike stations in under-served areas.
Analysis Conclusion: This finding suggests that there are underserved areas with a growing demand for bike sharing, especially during off-peak hours. It points to the importance of expanding bike stations into emerging neighborhoods where bike usage is rising, even if it's not in the traditional "tourist" or central business district locations.

Dashboard Design:
For each phenomenon, interactive dashboards were created:

Seasonal Ridership Dashboard:
Focused on visualizing bike usage patterns across seasons, along with subscriber trends.
Off-Peak Station Usage Dashboard:
Highlighted station popularity and the surprising off-peak usage in quieter neighborhoods.
Maps:
Static Map:

Plotted all bike stations with zip code data, highlighting the most popular locations.
Used color-coded markers to represent usage frequency.
Dynamic Map:

Showed station popularity over time (monthly/yearly) with dynamic filtering options.
Enabled city officials to analyze long-term trends and plan infrastructure investments effectively.
Final Presentation:
A Tableau story was created to bring together all visualizations and dashboards. The presentation focuses on:

Clarity: Each phenomenon was described with simple, understandable visualizations.
Insight: The analysis of unexpected phenomena provides actionable insights.
Aesthetics: The visualizations match Citi Bike’s branding for a professional, cohesive look.
